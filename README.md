# HardwareMonitor
**Requires the [HardwareMonitorClient](https://github.com/ChristianBenner/HardwareMonitorClient)** on the machine that you want to monitor the hardware of.

A network driven hardware monitor that can display hardware sensor data in a fully customizable and efficient way. The monitor is compatible with multiple operating systems including Raspberry Pi OS, Windows, Ubuntu and MacOS.

The reason this project exists was to display my computers hardware sensor information such as CPU and GPU temperatures. I've taken a step further so that less technical users can pick up the software - there is a large amount of customisation on how sensor data is displayed and automatic scanning for devices on the network.
